Brainstorm of ideas for the project:

MAIN IDEA:
Create a dashboard to analyse the holders of NFT projects (maybe only interesting for pfpNFT's)

HOW?:
-> Via dune
But I have no experience in sql, only solidity. 
But apparantly sql is easy to learn + We can use already existent code for some of the parameters

-> Code everything ourself:
I am very bad at front end but I learn fast + use examples online easily
I have some experience in JS and solidity 

WHAT PARAMETERS?:
- Relative importance of the NFT in the wallet (% of total worth)
- Average amount of NFTs of the collection per holders (cumulative/descriptive chart?)
- relative importance of the NFT in the total NFT holdings of the holders wallet (% worth)
- relative importance of the NFT in the total ETH holdings od the holders wallet
- average duration of holding 
- % of minteed NFT's still not sold a first time (long term holders?) !!! need to be relative to the age of the project

DISPLAY
- Index -> easier to compare collection
- Graph -> better visualisation


GO FURTHER:
- also include twitter data (more complicated and I think this couold be a lateer step)


STEP 1/
I will learn more about dune and maybe try to code in SQL to retrieve one parameter
